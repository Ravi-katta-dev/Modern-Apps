//! Avatar engine: per-surface lifecycle, preview camera, per-frame bone upload.
//!
//! The engine owns a map of live surfaces (`surfaceId -> SurfaceState`), each
//! with its own renderer, render thread generation, traits + pose, and size.
//! The CPU mesh bytes are shared across surfaces (single `Arc` allocation);
//! GPU buffers + UBO/pose stay per-surface. The render threads tick here;
//! [`tick_surface`] uploads the bone-matrix UBO and draws one surface per call.
