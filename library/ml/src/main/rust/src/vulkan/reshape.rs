//! A [`Net`] that re-records itself when the utterance changes length.
//!
//! Every Supertonic net is utterance-shaped: the duration predictor and the text encoder run at
//! the character count, the sampler at the latent length and the character count, the vocoder at
//! the latent length. A [`Plan`] is one command buffer recorded at fixed shapes, so a plan is only
//! ever right for one utterance, and [`Net::rebuild`] is how the next one gets its own.
//!
//! Doing that by hand needs two things kept in step per net — the table to rebuild from, and the
//! shape it is currently recorded at — and getting the second wrong is silent: a net left at the
//! previous sentence's length runs this sentence's data through it and returns the wrong number of
//! frames, or the right number computed over positions the arena happened to hold. So they live
//! together here, and a caller asks for the net *at a shape* rather than asking for the net.
