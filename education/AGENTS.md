- Package roots present: ui, data
- Entry files: MainActivity.kt + EducationApplication.kt (no Route.kt — shell + course/unit/lesson/quiz flow)
- Deps: :library:room, :youpipe:extractor, :library:network
- Metadata: metadata_data/education.md (present)
- Rust: no / screenshotTest: yes

## Overview
**Purpose:** Kids' learning app — age-banded K2 + explorer curriculum (lessons, quizzes, tracing, drag-match) with badges/streaks, parent gate, offline progress; video lessons stream via `:youpipe:extractor`.
**Key features:** Bundled curriculum (`content/` model + validator) → course/unit/lesson/quiz pages; learner progress + deadlines in Room; video player pages stream Khan/YouTube; narrator + downloader helpers.
**Entry points:** `EducationApplication.kt` → `MainActivity.kt` → `ui/Shell.kt` → `ui/HomePage.kt` → `util/EducationViewModel.kt` → `data/EducationRepository.kt`.
**Gotchas:**
- `content/` and `util/` are NOT closed package roots — pending migration; don't add more files there
- Curriculum content is validated (`ContentValidator`) — content edits must pass validation, not just compile
- Video is the only network use — everything else must work fully offline (classroom mode)
