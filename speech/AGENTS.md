## Overview
**Purpose:** Fully offline speech-to-text (Whisper) + text-to-speech (Supertonic) that also serves as the system `SpeechRecognizer` and TTS engine. All models ship in-app; works on clean install.
**Key features:**
- Whisper-base STT bundled, GPU-accelerated via the repo compute runtime (`:library:ml`); `WhisperRecognitionService` answers system recognition requests
- Supertonic 3 TTS, 10 voices × 31 languages (`SupertonicVoices` catalog); `SupertonicTtsService` answers system synthesis requests
- `MainActivity` is only a demo/settings surface — the services are the product
**Architecture / data-flow:** System binds `service/` endpoints → `util/WhisperEngine` (+ features/tokenizer/model) or `platform/SupertonicEngine` (+ `SupertonicModel`) → `:library:ml` GPU runtime; large assets ship bundled (`:library:downloadservice` only for updates/verification paths).
**Entry points + reading order:** `service/WhisperRecognitionService.kt` / `service/SupertonicTtsService.kt` → `util/WhisperEngine.kt` / `platform/SupertonicEngine.kt` → `domain/SupertonicVoices.kt` → `MainActivity.kt` (demo UI).
**Gotchas:**
- `tts/` and `util/` are NOT closed package roots — pending migration; don't add more files there
- Model files are large — asset/download changes need size + first-install testing, not just unit tests
- System-service contracts (recognition/TTS callbacks) are version-sensitive; keep the service surface stable
