## Overview
**Purpose:** Offline health-metric manager (Google Fit replacement) — activity/vitals/body/exercise/sleep/hydration/nutrition plus FHIR medical records, backed by Health Connect. No account, no cloud sync.
**Key features:**
- Per-metric dashboards with charts/history (`GenericLineChart`/`GenericBarChart`, hypnogram for sleep)
- Medications with dose schedules + exact reminders (`DoseScheduler`, `DoseSoundService`, boot-rescheduled); vaccinations from bundled CVX, drugs from RxNorm; card attachments (PDF/photo)
- Food logging against a bundled database + search API; AI insights via the on-device OpenAssistant model; file export
**Architecture / data-flow:** `ui/` Today + record pages → `platform/MedicalViewModel` (+ per-area `Medical*Ops`) → `data/HealthRepository` over Room (`Record`, `MedicationSchedule`, `MedicalRecords`) synced with Health Connect; `domain/` holds pure FHIR (Observations, Medication, Immunization, Allergy/Condition) + `DoseSchedule`; reminders flow `DoseScheduler` → receivers → `DoseReminderActivity` + `service/DoseSoundService`.
**Entry points + reading order:** `MainActivity.kt` → `ui/TodayPage.kt` → `platform/MedicalViewModel.kt` → `data/HealthRepository.kt` → `domain/FhirRecords.kt` → `platform/DoseScheduler.kt`.
**Gotchas:**
- `util/` is NOT a closed package root — the `util/`→closed-roots migration is pending; don't add more files there
- Medical data is dual-homed (Room + Health Connect) — writes must update both or they diverge
- Dose reminders need the boot path re-armed like clock alarms; sound runs through a foreground service
