## Overview
**Purpose:** US-only food-delivery client — restaurant browse, cart + Stripe checkout (pickup/delivery, tips, promos), live order tracking, deals/loyalty. Requires internet throughout.
**Key features:**
- Home/deals → restaurant → cart → checkout → success flow with modifier dialogs and totals; account addresses/auth/profile
- `data/CartStore` + `AddressStore` client state over `api/BitesApi`; order tracking in `notifications/` (live update + foreground tracking service)
- Assistant order lookup via `intents/OrderLookupIntent` (+ `ipc/OrderLookupContract`)
**Architecture / data-flow:** `ui/` flow screens → `platform/AppInit`-wired state (`data/CartStore`) → `api/BitesApi` backend; tracking runs in `notifications/OrderTrackingService` independent of the UI process.
**Entry points + reading order:** `FoodDeliveryApplication.kt` → `platform/AppInit.kt` → `MainActivity.kt` → `ui/HomeScreen.kt` → `ui/RestaurantScreen.kt` → `ui/CartScreen.kt` → `ui/CheckoutScreen.kt` → `api/BitesApi.kt`.
**Gotchas:**
- `api/` and `ipc/` are NOT closed package roots — pending migration; don't add more files there
- Payment data goes straight to Stripe tokenization — card numbers must never hit app state or logs
- Tracking must survive the app being killed; keep it in the service, not the ViewModel
