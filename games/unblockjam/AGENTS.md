## Overview
**Purpose:** Rush Hour sliding-block jam — 250 graded levels with optimal-move records + solver-checked daily level. 19 languages. 100% offline.
**Game shape:** Minimal `ui/` (theme/type) + board gestures in `platform/BlockDragGestures` → `platform/UnblockJamViewModel` → `domain/RushHourSolver` + `data/` level data/generator; dailies via `:library:work`; achievements → `:sdk:games` → hub.
**Entry points:** `Route` → `MainActivity.kt` → `Navigation.kt` → `platform/UnblockJamViewModel.kt` → `domain/RushHourSolver.kt`.
**Gotchas:** Level solvability + optimal-move counts come from the solver — level-pack edits must re-run it.
