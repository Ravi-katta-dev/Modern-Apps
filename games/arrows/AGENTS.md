## Overview
**Purpose:** Order-clearing arrow puzzle — every arrow must fly off unblocked; redirectors from level 11; daily board + 3-hearts escape overlay. 100% offline.
**Game shape (shared across MA games):** `ui/` board + screens → `platform/*ViewModel` (+ `UiContract`) → `domain/` pure rules/generator (+ solver where present) → `data/` progress store; achievements via `platform/*AchievementsManager` → `:sdk:games` → hub; daily boards via `:library:work`.
**Entry points:** `Route` → `MainActivity.kt` → `Navigation.kt` → `platform/ArrowsViewModel.kt` → `domain/ArrowsRules.kt`.
**Gotchas:** Every generated board must be clearable — generator changes need solvability checks.
