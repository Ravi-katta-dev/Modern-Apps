/**
 * The placeholder race: a software top-down model that unblocks lobby → race → results before the
 * native 3D engine lands.
 *
 * One lap is [TRACK_LENGTH] units; karts advance by throttle × [TOP_SPEED] per second, minus a
 * steering scrub. Positions are fractional progress in laps; [leaderboard] sorts by total progress.
 * AI drivers hold pace × wobble plus a rubber-band boost off the leader's progress (see
 * [effectiveAiPace]), so they are beatable but not statues.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and timestepped ([tick] takes seconds), so the race is a JVM test and
 * the native engine only has to reproduce its shape, not its code.
