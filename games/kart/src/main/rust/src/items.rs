//! Items and AI: what makes a race a race rather than a time trial.
//!
//! One item type per tier: a boost mushroom for the back of the pack, a
//! green shell that spins whoever it touches. AI drivers follow the racing
//! line with per-driver pace and wobble, and fire shells forward when they
//! hold one — beatable but not statues, mirroring the placeholder's 0.78 pace.
//! Backmarkers get a rubber-band pace boost that scales with their deficit
//! behind the leader (capped, so they close in without teleporting past);
//! the leader always runs base pace — no leader slowdown, by design.
