# AGENTS.md — share/ (':share')

> Scoped supplement. Global rules in root `AGENTS.md` apply. Stay inside `share/` + allowed shared modules. Do not root-scan.

_Install: ./install share (dev by default)._
<!-- last-reviewed: 2026-10-16 -->
- Gradle: :share / dir: share/
- Package roots present: ui, domain, platform, network
- Entry files: MainActivity.kt, Route.kt, Navigation.kt + SharePopupActivity.kt (share-sheet entry)
- Deps: (none declared — raw TCP/BLE transports, Rust protocol core)
- Metadata: metadata_data/share.md (present)
- Rust: yes / screenshotTest: yes

## Overview
**Purpose:** Offline Quick Share-compatible nearby file transfer — real protocol interop with stock Android, E2EE via UKEY2, device-to-device with no server.
**Key features:**
- Send from the system share sheet (`SharePopupActivity` → `SharePopupSheet`); discovery over BLE + NSD mDNS
- Encrypted TCP transport (`TcpTransport`, Rust `ShareNative` protocol core); receive with the app closed (Quick Settings tile + boot-gated controller)
- Received files stay app-private in `ReceivedFileStore` until the user saves/shares them
**Architecture / data-flow:** Send: share intent → popup → `ShareViewModel` → discovery managers → `ShareTransferService` → `TcpTransport`. Receive: tile/boot → `ShareReceiveController` → `PostGate` → notifier → `ShareSaveActivity`. `domain/protocol/ShareSession` models the handshake; `protocol/ShareNative` is the Rust JNI bridge.
**Entry points + reading order:** `SharePopupActivity.kt` (send) / `platform/receive/ShareReceiveController.kt` (receive) → `Route` → `Navigation.kt` → `platform/ShareViewModel.kt` → `domain/protocol/ShareSession.kt`.
**Gotchas:**
- `protocol/` is NOT a closed package root — pending migration; don't add more files there
- Protocol interop with stock Android is version-sensitive — changes need cross-device testing, not just unit tests
- Receive path must work with the app closed; never assume an Activity context there
