- Gradle: :youpipe:extractor / dir: youpipe/extractor/
- Package roots present: org.schabi.newpipe.extractor (upstream NewPipe API, not the closed set — third-party fork)
- Entry files: NewPipe.kt (`init` + service registry)
- Deps: protobuf-javalite, brotli-dec, jsr305 (no Modern-Apps modules)
- Metadata: absent (libraries none by design)
- Rust: no / screenshotTest: no

## Overview
**Purpose:** Pure-JVM YouTube/service extraction library — the NewPipe extractor fork that `:youpipe` uses to resolve streams, channels, playlists, search, and comments without the official API.
**Key features:**
- Per-service extractors (YouTube plus other services under `services/`) for streams, channels, playlists, search, suggestions, kiosks, and comments
- Localisation/time-ago parsing and pagination (`Page`, `ListExtractor`, `InfoItemsCollector`) for feed-style crawling
- Downloader abstraction — the host app injects its HTTP stack via `NewPipe.init(downloader)`
**Architecture / data-flow:** Host calls `NewPipe.init(downloader, localization)` once, resolves a `StreamingService` from `ServiceList`, then pulls typed `Info`/`ListInfo` objects through `Extractor` subclasses per entity; YouTube session PO-tokens plug in via `YoutubeSessionPoTokenProvider`. No Android, no Room, no network of its own — protobuf schemas under `src/main/proto` feed the YouTube player-response parsing.
**Entry points + reading order:** `NewPipe.kt` (`init`, `getService`) → `StreamingService.kt` → `Extractor.kt` / `ListExtractor.kt` → `services/youtube/` extractors → `downloader/Downloader.kt`.
**Gotchas:**
- This is a vendored upstream fork — prefer minimal surgical patches; large refactors will collide with upstream merges
- The old card was an empty stub (no roots, entries, or deps listed); all header fields are new from this rewrite
- Protobuf `lite` java builtin must stay `named("java")`, not `create` — the JVM path pre-registers it and a second create fails the build
