/**
 * The TV remote map for the player, modelled on YouTube for TV.
 *
 * Controls hidden (just watching):
 * - CENTER/ENTER/UP/DOWN: bring the controls up (focus lands on play/pause); the press that
 *   wakes them does not also act, so nobody loses their place by accident.
 * - LEFT/RIGHT: ±10s scrub preview while held, committed on release - no need to open anything.
 *
 * Controls visible: the D-pad belongs to the focus system (buttons, related row), except while
 * the seek bar holds focus, where LEFT/RIGHT scrub. Every press re-arms the auto-hide.
 *
 * Media keys (play/pause/next/prev/FF/REW) act whenever a player is attached. BACK dismisses the
 * topmost overlay first via [overlayDismiss]; only then does it navigate. Volume keys are left to
 * the system, which already moves the shared media level.
