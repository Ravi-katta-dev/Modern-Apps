## Overview
**Purpose:** Phone-side sender for offline screen mirroring + media handoff to the `cast/tv` receiver over your own Wi-Fi — E2EE session with pairing-code-bound handshake, no internet. Sibling `:cast:protocol` owns the wire; `:sdk:cast` is the third-party handoff API.
**Key features:**
- Mirroring pipeline: screen capture → video/audio encoders (`platform/mirror/`) → RTP sender → TV; codec negotiated from the receiver's capabilities so the phone sends full resolution
- Content casting (`CastContentSession`, `MediaProxyServer`) so other apps hand media off through `:sdk:cast`
- Discovery + pairing UI, Quick Settings tile start/stop, remote-display provider for system routing
**Architecture / data-flow:** `ui/` picker/status → `platform/CastViewModel` (+ `CastUiContract`) + `platform/CastController` → `platform/MirrorClient`/`CastConnection` over `network/` UDP + control sockets, framed by `:cast:protocol` (`StreamingSession`, `Pairing`); `service/CastService` + `ContentCastService` own the session lifetime.
**Entry points + reading order:** `Route` → `MainActivity.kt` → `Navigation.kt` → `platform/CastController.kt` → `platform/mirror/MirrorEngine.kt` → `network/ControlSocket.kt`.
**Gotchas:**
- Encoder support varies by device (`mirror/EncoderSupport`) — capability checks before assuming codecs
- Screen-capture consent is one-shot per session (`MirrorConsentActivity`); losing it mid-mirror kills the stream
- Keep `:cast:protocol` untouched from here — wire changes need sender + TV receiver updated together
