/**
 * Start and stop mirroring from the shade.
 *
 * A close transcription of `ShareReceiveTileService` with **one deliberate divergence**: `:share`
 * treats its persisted flag as authoritative and reconciles it headlessly after a reboot. Mirroring
 * cannot do that, because screen-capture consent is single-use and unreplayable. So tile state is
 * read from the in-process [CastController] instead: the foreground service keeps the process alive
 * for as long as mirroring is on, which means that if the process died, mirroring is dead and
 * `STATE_INACTIVE` is the truth. Only the *target* is persisted.
 *
 * A tile can also never start mirroring by itself - consent needs an Activity - so turning it on
 * connects first and then hands off to [MirrorConsentActivity] via `startActivityAndCollapse`.
 * The connect cannot be skipped: consent without a session dies silently in `startSession`, which
 * is exactly the dead tile tap - it only ever worked when the app process happened to already hold
 * one. Turning it off needs no Activity and goes straight to the controller.
 *
 * No `requestListeningState()`: nothing in this repo uses it and the house idiom is to reconcile on
 * the next listen.
