## Overview
**Purpose:** Android-TV receiver for the `cast/` sender — advertises, pairs, decodes and plays mirrored screen + handed-off media. Runs on TV, never evaluated as a phone app.
**Key features:**
- Receiver advertisement + pairing handshake (`ReceiverAdvertiser`, `ReceiverPairing`, `PairingStore`) against `:cast:protocol`
- Control channel + media loop (`ReceiverController`, `ReceiverMediaLoop`) feeding `ContentPlayer`/`AudioPlayer`/`VideoDecoder` with artwork fetch
- TV panel modes + transport overlay + now-playing UI (`PanelModes`, `TransportOverlay`, `NowPlaying`)
**Architecture / data-flow:** `service/ReceiverService` owns lifetime → `platform/ReceiverController` + `ControlChannel` → `ReceiverMediaLoop` → decoders/players → `ui/` TV surfaces; mirror input lands in `MirrorActivity`.
**Entry points + reading order:** `MainActivity.kt` → `service/ReceiverService.kt` → `platform/ReceiverController.kt` → `platform/ReceiverMediaLoop.kt` → `platform/ContentPlayer.kt`.
**Gotchas:**
- TV-only: no edge-to-edge phone chrome, D-pad focus matters, no touch assumptions
- Decoder capabilities feed back to the sender's codec negotiation — receiver bugs surface as sender quality drops
- Pairing store persists trust; clearing it force-drops all senders
