 * Keeps this TV listening while nothing is on screen.
 *
 * A receiver that stops advertising when its Activity goes away is not a receiver: the user opens the
 * app once and then expects the TV to be in the phone's list, including after the launcher has moved
 * on. `mediaPlayback` is the honest foreground type - the service holds two sockets and decodes a
 * stream - and it is not subject to Android 15's cumulative-runtime cap, which covers only `dataSync`
 * and `mediaProcessing`.
 *
 * `START_STICKY`, unlike `:cast`'s service: there is genuinely something to restore here. A restarted
 * receiver just re-advertises and waits, with no consent token or single-use permission involved.
 *
 * The service also opens the app itself when a phone connects while nothing is on screen. A direct
 * start is tried first and a full-screen intent is posted alongside it, the same pairing `clock`'s
 * `AlarmReceiver` uses: the direct start only survives when an exemption holds, and the intent is
 * what actually brings the TV forward from the background. Without either, a pairing code would sit
 * unseen in state until its socket timed out.
