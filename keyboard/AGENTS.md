- Gradle: :keyboard / dir: keyboard/
- Package roots present: ui, platform
- Entry files: MainActivity.kt (settings/setup UI) + ime/KeyboardService.kt (the actual IME entry)
- Deps: (none — zero network permission by design)
- Metadata: metadata_data/keyboard.md (present)
- Rust: no / screenshotTest: yes

## Overview
**Purpose:** Private offline keyboard (IME) with Material You — no network permission at all, so keystrokes cannot leave the device.
**Key features:**
- Full IME (`KeyboardService`) with letters/symbols/function rows, key popups, adjustable height, suggestion strip
- CJK + Indic composition: Han (Pinyin), Kana, Hangul, Ethiopic composers over `TextBeforeCursor`
- Emoji pages + search, clipboard strip/page, voice-input strip (gated by a permission activity)
**Architecture / data-flow:** System binds `ime/KeyboardService` → `ime/KeyboardState` + `Composer` routespre-edit composition → `ui/` rows/pages render keys; `util/` holds layouts (Latin/Cyrillic/Other), dictionaries (incl. Pinyin), prefs, clipboard store. `MainActivity` is only the setup/settings UI, not the keyboard.
**Entry points + reading order:** `ime/KeyboardService.kt` → `ime/KeyboardState.kt` → `ime/Composer.kt` → `ui/KeyboardScreen.kt` → `util/KeyboardLayouts*.kt`.
**Gotchas:**
- `ime/` and `util/` are NOT closed package roots — pending migration; don't add more files there
- No-network is a guarantee, not an accident — never add a network dep or permission here
- Voice input needs its own permission activity before the strip works
