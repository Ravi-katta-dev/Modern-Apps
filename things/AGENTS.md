## Overview
**Purpose:** BLE hyd ration tracker — pairs a smart water bottle, totals sips against a daily goal. No account, no cloud; readings stay on the phone. (Scale BLE files are legacy/experimental alongside.)
**Key features:** Scan/pair/disconnect, live per-sip history, goal progress; Health Connect bridge helper; permissions-gated onboarding.
**Entry points:** `Route` → `MainActivity.kt` → `Navigation.kt` → `ui/HomePage.kt` → `platform/DeviceController.kt` → `platform/BleManager.kt`.
**Gotchas:** BLE behavior is device- and radio-state-dependent — test scan/pair/drop/reconnect on hardware, not the emulator.
