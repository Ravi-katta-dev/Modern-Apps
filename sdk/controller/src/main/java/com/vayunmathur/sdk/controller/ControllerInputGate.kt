/**
 * The per-player inbound policy: replay window plus rate limit.
 *
 * Extracted from `ControllerHost` so the whole rule is a JVM test: the host owns one gate per
 * player and publishes only what the gate accepts. Both checks are per-player, so one faulty or
 * hostile client cannot crowd out the rest of the grid.
 *
 * The sequence rule comes first: anything at or below the high-water mark is a replay (or a
 * duplicate of an already-applied sample) and is ignored without touching the rate window, so
 * replays can never consume budget. Over the rate limit, samples are dropped rather than applied.
 *
 * UDP later changes nothing here: [seq], the window, and the idempotent per-sample apply are the
 * reason the swap is transport-only.
