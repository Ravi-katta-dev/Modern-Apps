 * Generic controller input, from any phone or gamepad, for any TV game.
 *
 * [buttons] is a bitmask of [ControllerButton] bits; [axes] holds the normalized sticks in slot
 * order ([AXIS_LEFT_X], [AXIS_LEFT_Y], [AXIS_RIGHT_X], [AXIS_RIGHT_Y], [AXIS_THROTTLE],
 * [AXIS_BRAKE]); [hatX]/[hatY] is the D-pad as -1/0/1. [touchX]/[touchY] carry an optional second
 * pointer (a look stick on phones that have one), normalized -1..1, or null when unused.
 *
 * [seq] is per-player and strictly increasing; the host keeps a replay window and ignores anything
 * at or below the high-water mark. [clientTimestampMs] is the phone's `uptimeMillis` at sample
 * time, so the host can measure skew and jitter without trusting the clock.
