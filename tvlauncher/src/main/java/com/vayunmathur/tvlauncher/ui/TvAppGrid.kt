/**
 * The app banner grid: six 16:9 tiles per row like the tv-detox reference.
 *
 * A plain flow of tiles, not a LazyVerticalGrid: this grid lives inside the screen's
 * layout, and a lazy container measures with infinite max height there, which Compose
 * forbids (fatal IllegalStateException on launch). A TV row holds at most a few dozen
 * static tiles, so laziness buys nothing here.
 *
 * Fits without scrolling: at most [MAX_ROWS] rows are shown, and tiles size from the
 * available height via [BoxWithConstraints] so the grid always fits its weighted slot.
 *
 * Reorder behaviour (the part that has to feel right from a sofa):
 * - every tile owns a stable [FocusRequester] keyed by package, so focus identity survives
 *   list moves instead of sticking to the old index;
 * - while a tile is held ([TvHomeState.movingKey]), every move re-requests focus on the
 *   held tile's requester, so the cursor travels *with* the tile instead of snapping back
 *   to where it was picked up;
 * - each tile animates its own horizontal offset toward its current slot on the platform
 *   reorder spec, so neighbours visibly slide aside instead of teleporting — the eye
 *   follows the held tile because everything else glides out of its way.
